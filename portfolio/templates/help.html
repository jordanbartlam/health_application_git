                        <p>Longevity represents life expectancy. The average life expectancy is estimated at around 80. However, with frequent activity we can expect the life expectancy to rise. This new life expectancy is listed under 'Earned'.</p>
                        <p>Mobility is measured using a scale from 1 to 12. A mobility score of 12 is the highest attainable, and reflects exceptional fitness. Conversely, a score of 1 conveys a low level of activity.</p>
                        <p>Wellbeing is a combination of the two other measures. This helps to estimate the overall happiness. It ranges from a score of 0% to 100%.</p>

Furthermore, the total carbon emissions avoided by all users of the site is presented at the bottom of the page.</p>
                        <p>For each 12kg of carbon emission savings, users will be awarded 1 More Life Token (MLT) and 0.2MLT will be allocated to the More Life Pool. MLT tokens represent an offset of carbon output and could enable companies and employers to offset the carbon footprint of their business, and individuals to offset their carbon footprint. The More Life Pool may be used to fund expenses of the business, generate returns and provide member bonuses as well as support environmental and health initiatives.</p>
                        <p>Users may buy, sell or retire MLT by inserting the relevant amount they wish to buy, sell or retire on the Environmental Dashboard in which case transfer or retirement will occur at the then current More Life Pool price.
